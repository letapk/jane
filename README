Jane 0.1
========

What is Jane?
--------------
Jane stores your thoughts and ideas as notes to yourself.

Why is it called Jane?
----------------------
Because Jane is Another Note Editor?

What can it do, in its present form?
------------------------------------
If you are in the habit of keeping notes, or a diary, or a journal of
your activities, Jane can keep them organised and accessible.

That's nice, but does it ever do anything useful?
-------------------------------------------------
If it does, it does it when I'm not looking. Besides, if it did, do you think
I would be giving it away free?

While there is no guarantee that it will do anything useful, or anything at all,
there is every probability of the version number increasing in the future as
and when I get the time to add more features (especially if anyone asks).

Availability
------------
Jane is available as source code to compile on your own machine.

Compiling the source
--------------------
All the source files are available on Github under the following link:
https://github.com/letapk/jane

The repository is public. Anyone can check out the branch onto her local machine.

In addition, you will need the libraries and developement files from Qt, which are
available from the depository of your Linux distribution or from www.qt.io.

If you are using QtCreator, load the project file jane.pro which is available in the source
package. Select the version you want to build (debug version or release version) and hit
Ctrl-B. If there are no problems, this should build the binary.

The program has been compiled and tested on version 5.15.2 of Qt, under Ubuntu
22.04.3.

The binary may be stored locally in a directoriy separate from the source subdirectory,
depending on how QtCreator is configured. This location will be available within QtCreator.

If you are not using QtCreator, running the comand:
qmake jane.pro
should create a Makefile for your system. Then, running:
make
should create a running binary.

When the program is executed, Jane searches for a hidden subdirectory called
“.jane”. If this is absent (which will be the case when it is executed the first
time) it issues a notification that it will be created. Subsequently all data is
stored in this subdirectory.

Exit the program and copy the help and image files in the downloaded package to the
hidden data subdirectory. Either use a file manager or open a terminal and do the
following from within the Jane subdirectory:

cp janehelp.* ~/.jane
cp COPYING ~/.jane

Remember to put the dot (".") in the right place. This will make the on-line help
available when the program is running.

If you are using QtCreator, the location of the locally compiled binary will be
available from within QtCreator. If not, the binary will be in the same location as the
source files. From this location copy the binary to a place from where everyone working
on the computer can run it.

From the subdirectory containing the binary do:
sudo cp ./jane /usr/local/bin/jane
Enter your user password when prompted.
